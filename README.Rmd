# coronaaus

This package uses coronavirus data to generate outputs to inform users about the state of coronavirus in each state/territory. They can compare the number of new infections, deaths and recovered cases in each area. 

## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-EmilySheehan0012")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(coronaaus)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
#summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
